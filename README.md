Hi Muzjib,

I used this code while doing a training on react/redux.

This was created using create-react-app.

This uses fetch to get json data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com which provide dummy data for api testing.

Also app uses Redux structure. This illustrates two action types. One is to fetch the data and to create new data upon button submit.

Please note project does contain default files that came with using create-react-app.
